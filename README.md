# Week-3-Challenge

## Project Purpose: 
Using Python, we will be performing an analysis to analyse the data for an election in Denver. This analysis will provide the demographics of how the votes are distributed throughout different counties, as well as how votes are scatterred between the candidates. Let's jump into the election analysis and walk through the process.
